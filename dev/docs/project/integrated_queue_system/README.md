## What I Learned
### Android
* Firebase
* Google Maps API
* RecyclerView with **multiple type Views**

### C#
* some method about async

### Other
* the Project Competition is peeve generator

## Summary
This project is mainly divided into two parts: **Enterprise Side** and **Client Side**.
The enterprise side has **a host** which can control the entire room, and **some devices** for the counters.
The client side is **the APP** on the phone.

I was mainly responsible for **the APP** and some code of **the host**.

## The Main Functions
### Basic Functions
* Ticket Machine: the touch screen for taking number plates
* Printer: print number plates
* Caption Machine: call and display the current number
* Counter Machine: the equipment for service personnel

### Extra Features
* Queue Logic: a system that can reduce performance dispute among the service personnel (encounters)
* Customized Service: merchants can adjust service content in time by themselves
* Cloud Service: cloudize the process of queuing, so that customers do not have to wait for a call on the spot

## Other Functions
* users can compare the distance, status, etc. of businesses of the same type
* combine cloud database for big data analysis to understand customer preferences

## After Doing This
Since this project is too large and there are so many details to be dealt with, it simply cannot be done.
I think **lack of thoughtfulness and effective communication among team members** are the most serious problems.
The concept is quite good, but it must be popularized if it is to be practically used.
So there is still a long way to go before commercial use.
