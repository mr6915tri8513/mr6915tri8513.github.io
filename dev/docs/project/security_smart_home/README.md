This project has gone through 1 and 2 generations.
With the addition of new member, the technology and integrity were getting better.

I was mainly responsible for **Arduino** and **part of the APP**,
as well as **the translation** of the report.

## What I learned
### Android
* RecyclerView **Items' moving(dragging)**

### Arduino
* **OTA** and **EEPROM** about **ESP32** and **ESP8266**
* tried **P2P(Peer to Peer)** to replace **AP** (ESP32 and ESP8266 not supported)
* tried **Socket Server** instead of **HTTP Server** (Just... don't know what's wrong with ESP8266 (#｀-_ゝ-) )

### Others
* a little English ability

## Summary
This is a project about the **IOT**, featuring **quick installation**, **low cost** and **high security**.

## The Main Functions
### Home Device
* monitor the power usage of each appliance
* remote control the power switch
* can be modified depends on customer needs

### Outdoor Mode
* reuse your old phone
* record the stranger's face and upload it
* a notification will also be sent if no one is home at that time

### Offline Mode
* even if the Internet goes down, it won't take everything down

## Other Functions
### OTA (Over-the-Air Programming)
* devices can stay the latest version by simply connecting to the Internet
* sometimes a little surprise can be added to it as well

## After Doing This
This is the first time I have participated in the production of a project.
For the first time, I have known **what a project is**.
The size and complexity are not at the same level as those homeworks I have done before.
The process was hard, though, it was the one I learned the most, as well as the most successful one so far.
