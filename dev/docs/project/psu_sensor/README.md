This project is for a competition in my school. The concept and the title were conceived by sstteeeenn05,
while I was in charge of the app.

## What I Learned
### Arduino
* classic bluetooth for ESP32
* DrawerLayout

### Android
* classic bluetooth

### Others
* Google Charts (Line Chart)
* Base64

## Summary
It has two parts: **the app** on the phone and **PSU Sensor** (the one in the box)

After installing PSU Sensor in the place where it should be installed, setting up on the phone with bluetooth,
you can just use it. EASY!
